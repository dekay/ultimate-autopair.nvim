+ remember to sort
+ give better name for objman
+ hook.lua handle both input and output
+ remake extensions into extensions for action type extensions and filters for filtering type extensions
    + make seperate config (maybe?)
    + makes it easy to chose what filters apply and if they work only on insert or global (or only noninsert)
